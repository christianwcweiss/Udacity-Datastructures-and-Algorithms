## Exercise 5

Data Structures:
I used a linked list to connect the blocks together and a dictionary to store the hash values

Time complexity:
adding an item O(1)
looping back to the first hash takes O(n) with n, being the number of blocks in the blockchain

Space complexity:
O(n) complexity + hashes
