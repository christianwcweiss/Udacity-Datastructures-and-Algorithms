## Exercise 2

Data Structures:
I chose a stack, because (at least for me) this is
easier to use for this problem than recursion.
Using a stack also is less time/space complex than using
a recursive solution for this problem.
Other datastructures that could be used would be a queue,
regular list or even a linked list. I decided for a stack,
because it's straight-forward and python allows a built-in
solution with the methods .pop and .append

Time complexity:
O(n) with n being the number of folders and files in the
directory

Space complexity:
O(n) is worst-case if all folders/files are directly under the
main directory
