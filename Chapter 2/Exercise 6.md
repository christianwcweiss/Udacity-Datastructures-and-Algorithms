## Exercise 6

Data Structures:
I used a set to lookup if an element was already added to the result ll.
Sets allow O(1) lookup time and I don't need a key/value as in a dictionary

Time complexity:
O(m+n) m=lenght of l1 and n=length of l2

Space complexity:
O(2(m+n)) since I save also the values in the set
