# Exercise 4

### Explanation
Initially, I thought of using 3 arrays, where I sort each element and later on concatenate.
However, this adds additional space complexity and the sorting can be done in-place.
The solution requires placing the 0s and 2s in the correct place, which leaves a sorted array.

### Time Complexity
O(n)

### Space complexity
O(1)
