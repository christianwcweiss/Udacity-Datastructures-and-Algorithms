#Exercise 4

###Explanation
For this topic I added a bit more space complexity to solve it.
Initially, I thought of using 3 arrays, where I sort each element and later on concatenate.
However, this adds additional space complexity and the sorting can be done in-place.
The solution requires placing the 0s and 2s in the correct place.
This leaves a sorted array.

###Time Complexity
O(n)

###Space complexity
O(1)
